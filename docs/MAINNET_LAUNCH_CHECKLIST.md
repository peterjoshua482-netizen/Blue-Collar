## Launch Day: Contract Deployment

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Set mainnet environment
export STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet
export STELLAR_RPC=https://soroban-rpc.stellar.org
export STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
export ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=<from-vault>
```

### Step 1 — Build WASM Artifacts

```bash
cd packages/contracts
make build
# Verify WASM hashes match the audited commit
sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm
```

### Step 2 — Deploy Contracts (in order)

Contracts must be deployed in dependency order. Each outputs a contract ID — save these immediately.

```bash
# 1. Registry (no dependencies)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_registry.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet
# SAVE output as REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID

# 2. FeeDistribution (no dependencies)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_fee_distribution.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet
# SAVE output as FEE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT_ID

# 3. Dispute (no dependencies)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_dispute.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet
# SAVE output as DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ID

# 4. InsurancePool (no dependencies)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_insurance_pool.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet
# SAVE output as INSURANCE_POOL_CONTRACT_ID

# 5. Market (depends on previously deployed contracts if referenced)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_market.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet
# SAVE output as MARKET_CONTRACT_ID
```

### Step 3 — Initialize Contracts

```bash
# Initialize Registry with admin address
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- init \
  --admin <admin-address>

# Initialize FeeDistribution with recipient addresses
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FEE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- init \
  --admin <admin-address> \
  --recipients <comma-separated-recipient-addresses>

# Initialize Dispute contract with arbitrator addresses
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- init \
  --admin <admin-address> \
  --arbitrators <comma-separated-arbitrator-addresses>

# Initialize InsurancePool
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$INSURANCE_POOL_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- init \
  --admin <admin-address>

# Initialize Market
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$MARKET_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- init \
  --admin <admin-address>
```

### Step 4 — Verify On-Chain State

```bash
# Verify each contract is initialized
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- admin

# Should return the admin address
```

### Step 5 — Record Contract IDs

Save all contract IDs to your secret manager and update environment configs:

```env
# Production environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID=<registry-contract-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_CONTRACT_ID=<market-contract-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ID=<dispute-contract-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT_ID=<fee-distribution-contract-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_POOL_CONTRACT_ID=<insurance-pool-contract-id>
```

Write contract IDs to an encrypted file for offline backup:

```bash
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 bluecollar-mainnet-contract-ids.txt
# Store this in a safe location (not in the repository)
```

---

## Launch Day: Infrastructure Deployment

### Step 1 — Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# Apply Terraform (review plan first!)
cd deploy/terraform
terraform workspace select production
terraform plan -var-file=environments/production.tfvars -out=plan.tfplan
# Have a second person review the plan
terraform apply plan.tfplan
```

### Step 2 — Deploy Application

Using ArgoCD (production requires manual sync):

```bash
# Verify ArgoCD applications exist
argocd app list

# Sync API - manual approval step
argocd app sync bluecollar-api --namespace production

# Sync App - manual approval step
argocd app sync bluecollar-app --namespace production
```

Or using the deploy script:

```bash
./deploy/scripts/deploy-with-rollback.sh production v1.0.0
```

### Step 3 — Run Database Migrations

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/bluecollar-api -n production -- \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 4 — Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check deployment health
kubectl rollout status deployment/bluecollar-api -n production
kubectl rollout status deployment/bluecollar-app -n production

# Check pods are running
kubectl get pods -n production
```

---

## Launch Day: Smoke Tests

Run the smoke test suite to validate the deployment:

```bash
# Run smoke tests
./deploy/scripts/smoke-tests.sh \
  --api-url https://api.bluecollar.com \
  --app-url https://app.bluecollar.com
```

### Manual Smoke Test Checklist

| Test Case | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Health check | `curl -f https://api.bluecollar.com/health` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| Categories list | `curl https://api.bluecollar.com/api/categories` | 200, array of categories |
| App loads | `curl -f https://app.bluecollar.com/en/workers` | 200, HTML content |
| Wallet connect | Open app, connect Freighter wallet | Wallet address displayed |
| Contract read | Invoke `get_worker` via app or CLI | Returns contract data or appropriate error |
| Login flow | `POST /auth/login` with test credentials | 202, token returned |
| Register user | `POST /auth/register` | 201, user created |

### Verify Contract Integration

```bash
# Read from Registry contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- list_workers

# Should return empty list (or existing test data)
```

---

## Post-Launch: Monitoring

### First 24 Hours (Hyper-Care)

- [ ] Monitor API error rate in Grafana — must stay below 1%
- [ ] Monitor API latency (p95 < 500ms)
- [ ] Monitor database connections and query performance
- [ ] Monitor contract transaction success rate
- [ ] Monitor wallet connection success rate
- [ ] Check logs for unexpected errors every 2 hours
- [ ] Verify backup ran successfully (daily)
- [ ] Check TLS certificate validity
- [ ] Verify alerting is firing correctly (test with a known issue)

### First Week (Steady-State)

- [ ] Review and tune alert thresholds based on observed baseline
- [ ] Verify fee distribution transactions are processing
- [ ] Monitor XLM balance of admin account (refill if low)
- [ ] Monitor storage TTL extension calls (bots/users extending entries)
- [ ] Review first week's incident log (if any)
- [ ] Publish post-launch retrospective

### Ongoing

| Task | Frequency | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Backup verification | Daily | Ops |
| Log review | Daily | On-call |
| Grafana dashboard review | Weekly | Team |
| Dependency updates | Weekly | Dev |
| Secret rotation (JWT, OAuth, SMTP) | Quarterly | Ops |
| Contract upgrade review | Per release | Dev |

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Contract Deployment

If a contract has a critical bug, use the `upgrade` function to deploy a fixed WASM:

```bash
# 1. Build fixed WASM
cd packages/contracts
make build

# 2. Install new WASM to get its hash
stellar contract install \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bluecollar_registry.wasm \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet

# 3. Upgrade contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- upgrade \
  --admin <admin-address> \
  --new_wasm_hash <new-wasm-hash>
```

> **Note:** Contract upgrades preserve storage. You cannot revert to a previous WASM version after upgrade; you must deploy the old code as a "new" upgrade.

### Rollback Application Deployment

```bash
# Using kubectl (quick rollback)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/bluecollar-api -n production
kubectl rollout undo deployment/bluecollar-app -n production

# Using ArgoCD
argocd app rollback bluecollar-api --namespace production

# Using the deploy script
./deploy/scripts/rollback.sh production
```

### Rollback Database Migration

If a Prisma migration introduced a breaking change:

1. **Do NOT run `prisma migrate deploy` on the new migration** if you suspect it may fail.
2. Rollback the application first (above).
3. To revert an already-applied migration:
   ```bash
   # Connect directly to the database (not through PgBouncer)
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-name>
   ```
4. Manually revert schema changes if necessary (requires DBA access).
5. Verify the previous application version works with the reverted schema.

> Destructive migrations (DROP COLUMN, DROP TABLE, ALTER COLUMN) must always be reversible. Prefer additive migrations and schedule cleanup migrations separately.

### Database Restore (Full Disaster)

If data corruption or loss occurs:

```bash
# 1. Stop the API (prevent further writes)
kubectl scale deployment bluecollar-api -n production --replicas=0

# 2. Restore from latest verified backup
./deploy/scripts/restore-database.sh production

# 3. Verify restored data
./deploy/scripts/verify-backup.sh production

# 4. Restart API
kubectl scale deployment bluecollar-api -n production --replicas=3

# 5. Run smoke tests
./deploy/scripts/smoke-tests.sh --api-url https://api.bluecollar.com

# 6. File incident report (see docs/INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md)
```

## Key Custody

### Key Inventory

| Key | Purpose | Custodian(s) | Backup Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract Admin Secret | Deploy & upgrade contracts | 2-of-3 multi-sig | Hardware wallet + encrypted USB |
| API JWT Secret | Sign user session tokens | Ops lead | Vault + encrypted backup |
| Database Password | API → PostgreSQL | Ops lead | Vault |
| Google OAuth Secret | OAuth 2.0 login | Ops lead | Vault |
| SMTP Password | Email sending | Ops lead | Vault |
| VAPID Private Key | Web push notifications | Ops lead | Vault |
| TLS Private Key | HTTPS termination | Ops lead | Vault |

### Key Management Principles

1. **No keys in source control** — all secrets injected at runtime via Vault / cloud secret manager
2. **Principle of least privilege** — each deployment environment uses separate credentials
3. **Rotation schedule** — JWT, OAuth, SMTP, VAPID rotated quarterly; DB password rotated after any team change
4. **Audit trail** — all key access logged (Vault audit log)
5. **Recovery** — contract admin key has a documented recovery process (hardware wallet backup + social recovery)

### Contract Admin Key Ceremony

The contract admin key is the most sensitive credential. Use a 2-of-3 multi-sig:

1. Generate key on an air-gapped machine
2. Split into 3 shards using Shamir's Secret Sharing
3. Distribute shards to 3 trusted team members
4. Store the full key on a hardware wallet in a safety deposit box
5. Document the recovery procedure in the team's emergency plan
