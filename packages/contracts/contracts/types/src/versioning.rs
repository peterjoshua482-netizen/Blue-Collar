//! Standardized versioning and upgrade pattern for BlueCollar contracts.
//!
//! Defines the contract versioning strategy and provides common utilities for
//! version management, schema migrations, and upgrade verification.
//!
//! ## Versioning Strategy
//!
//! Each contract maintains TWO independent version numbers:
//!
//! 1. **Event Schema Version** (`VERSION` constant)
//!    - Incremented when events are added, removed, or renamed
//!    - Consumers subscribe to `version()` for event structure
//!    - Current: 1 (baseline event structure)
//!
//! 2. **Storage Schema Version** (stored in persistent storage)
//!    - Incremented when persistent storage layout changes
//!    - Checked during initialization and migrations
//!    - Enables safe schema upgrades via `migrate()`
//!    - Current: typically 1, incremented on breaking storage changes
