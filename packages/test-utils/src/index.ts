/**
 * @bluecollar/test-utils
 *
 * Shared test utilities across all BlueCollar packages.
 *
 * Sub-path exports:
 *   '@bluecollar/test-utils/factories' — Data factories (userFactory, workerFactory, …)
 *   '@bluecollar/test-utils/react'     — renderWithProviders for React/Next.js tests
 *
 * Root export (this file) re-exports everything so you can import from the
 * package root when you need multiple things:
 *
 *   import { userFactory, makeRequest, makeResponse } from '@bluecollar/test-utils'
